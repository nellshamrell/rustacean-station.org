__Nell Shamrell-Harrington__: Greetings, fellow Rustaceans! We’re back with another episode of This Week in Rust on the Rustacean station.

As always, I’m Nell Shamrell-Harrington, lead editor of This Week in Rust and also a Sr. Staff Research Engineer on the Rust team at Mozilla. 

This episode covers issue number 350 of This Week in Rust, published on August 4, 2020.

We are continuing with dividing our news and blog post section into subsections. Thank you to all who expressed your feedback on Reddit and Twitter, it seems you really like the subheadings, and we are going to continue to do them.

Additionally, I’m going to do something special on this podcast for the next few weeks. RustConf is coming up on Thursday August 20. I’m MCing the conference and am getting ready by interviewing the upcoming RustConf speakers. Each interview is 5-10 minutes long and we’ll start off this week with Sian Griffin, Jane Lusby, and Ashley Hauck. Each speaker will introduce themselves and give you a brief preview of their talk at the end of this episode.

First, the news.

In official announcements, we had not one but two new versions of Rust released this week. Rust 1.45.1 is a collection of fixes. It addresses bugs that only affected the 1.45.0 release. Rust 1.45.2 is also a collection of fixes, one fix for 1.45.1 and one for 1.45.0. Check out the blog posts for more information.

Moving on to tooling, I’d like to highlight a new project called Headcrab, which just published its July 2020 progress report. Headcrab, which I’ve mentioned on this podcast before, is a project to create a new modular and composable debugger library for Rust. This project looks very promising and I encourage you to check it out and get involved.

Next, a new section of the newsletter called “Newsletters”. While This Week in Rust provides a general overview of what is going on with the Rust language and in the Rust community, there are several specialized newsletters that focus specifically on Rust gamedev, Rust and blockchain, and, as featured this week, Rust OSDev. This Month in Rust OSDev provides a regular overview of notable changes in the Rust operating system development ecosystem. Take a look at the full newsletter for updates to projects hosted under the rust-osdev GitHub organization, as well as updates to personal projects also related to Rust OS Dev.

Like last week, and I think like most weeks going forward, the learning section has by far the most articles.

Ferrous Systems has published the first in a series of posts called “Learning Rust: Mindsets and Expectations”. This series will cover patterns for learning Rust effectively. These patterns are based on interviews with many different Rust developers about how they learned and found success with Rust. In the article’s own words “Give some time to your learning process, and you'll see that core concepts like Ownership and Borrowing deliver joy: they make it easy and comfortable to write programs that are memory-safe!”

Speaking of memory safety, Tiemoko Ballo has published “Blue Team Rust: What is ‘Memory Safety’, really?” Ballo explores what “safe” means on a technical level. This includes going over what exactly Rust’s “memory safety guarantees” are — including stack protection, heap protection, references always being valid and variables initialized before use, and data races being completely eliminated. There are some caveats when discussing memory safety in Rust. In particular, not all Rust code is memory safe - memory safety guarantees apply broadly, not universally. Unsafe Rust code drops memory safety guarantees for a limited scope and doesn’t eliminate all checks. Additionally, Interior mutability can push borrow checks to runtime. 

To quote the author: 

“Memory safety is not a new idea, garbage collection and smart pointers have been around for a while. But sometimes it's the right implementation of an existing good idea that makes for a novel great idea. Rust's ownership paradigm  — which implements an affine type system — is that great idea, enabling safety without sacrificing predictable performance.”

In a previous issue, we featured an article on packaging Rust applications for Windows by Ryan Gorup, founder of Ebbflow. Gorup has now followed up with a new post that covers how Ebbflow packages its Rust applications for Linux. The article is broken up into problems that Ebbflow needed to solve after the core code for their client was written. These problems included figuring out how to run a daemon in the background - which was solved by creating a systemd service and including a systemd unit file in the compiled packages. These problems also included statically linking dependencies using a MUSL target with rustup and using rustls. Finally, they also had to develop different packages for different Linux distributions. They used cargo deb to create deb packages and cargo-rpm to create rpm packages. There will be another post in the future on automating builds and vending those builds to users.

One of the most fascinating articles to me in this week’s issue is “Reverse Engineering a USB Device with Rust.” Harry Gill, the author of the post, was building a new workstation with the AMD Ryzen 3950x CPU and trying to get the maximum performance out of it to reduce Rust compile times. Gill used a Corsair H150i RGB PRO XT AIO to cool the new computer. It was working well, until they discovered that Corsair does not provide any support for Linux, which meant Gill could only adjust settings for and view the status of cooling through Windows. Not to be deterred, the article goes on to describe how they researched USB protocol and used tools like USBPcap to capture packets being transmitted between the cooling unit and the PC. Next, Gill created a Rust project to read information from, configure, and send commands to the cooling device from Linux. This is a really cool project and a great introduction to reverse engineering USB devices

One of my favorite ways to learn and practice new programming languages — or refine my technique with known programming languages — is through Exercism IO. Exercism IO is a site where anyone can download exercises for various programming languages, solve the exercises, submit them back up to Exercism, and then receive mentorship on their solutions by volunteers. One of the challenges of Exercism is that it can take some time for a live person to get around to reviewing a submission. Sean Chen, a contributor to Exercism IO, describes this problem and a potential solution in the blog post titled “Some Learnings from Implementing a Normalizing Rust Representer”. Chen wanted to decrease wait times for students by streamlining the feedback process for Exercism mentors. One thing Chen realized would help would be normalizing the submissions by stripping away things like formatting, comments, and variable names so the mentor could focus on the logical approach of the submission. Chen created a Rust normalizing representer that parses the source code of submissions into an abstract syntax tree, then applies transformations to the appropriate tree nodes, and finally turns the tree back into a string representing the transformed source code. See the blog post for more information about the implementation of this normalizer — to me it felt very similar to how the Rust compiler works.

My other favorite way to learn and practice Rust is through the Rustlings exercises. Rustlings is a collection of small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code, including reading and responding to compiler messages. Chris Biscardi has put together a series of videos that show them working through the various Rustlings exercises. I have been through all of the Rustlings exercises myself and there were 2 or 3 that I could never fully figure out the answer to. I’m looking forward to watching and learning from the videos on those exercises.

Moving onto project updates. The Rust Language Cheat sheet, also known as cheats.rs, is a project from GitHub user ralfbiedert. It is a single page Rust resource for people who like high information density. Ralfbiedert has written up a status update that details changes to the project from 2019-2020, including a complete rewrite of the Memory and Lifetimes section, the addition of a visual section, coding guides, and much more.

Under the miscellaneous heading in this week’s newsletter we feature two episodes of The Virtual Worlds Podcast. The Virtual World podcast by Ty Tracey is a podcast about Software Engineering, Technology, VR, Art, Music, Creativity, Inclusivity, and Love. This week they posted two “State of Rust” episodes — one with Alex Chrichton and one with Steve Klabnik. 

Moving onto RFCs, one RFC was approved this week — the `C unwind` ABI. It has been exciting to watch the progress of this RFC from it’s very beginning to its acceptance. We’ve covered this RFC on previous episodes of this podcast, please refer to those episodes or to the RFC itself for more details.

Two new RFCs were proposed this week. The first, titled “Edition 2021 and beyond”, revises rules and plans for Rust editions. It announces plans for a Rust 2021 edition and for a regular cadence of editions every 3 years. In the RFCs own words: “Unlike Rust 2018, we will avoid using editions as a "deadline" to tie together high-priority projects. We specify a cadence for Edition lints. We specify a policy on reserving keywords and other prospective changes.” See the full RFC for all the details and discussion.

The second new RFC is titled “Procedural vtables and wide ptr metadata”. To quote the RFC’s summary “Building a wide pointer from a concrete pointer (and thus vtable generation) can be controlled by choosing a custom wide pointer type for the trait. The custom wide pointer must implement a trait that generates said wide pointer by taking a concrete pointer and a generic description of a trait impl. By default, if no vtable generator function is specified for a specific trait, the unspecified scheme used today keeps getting used.”

Now, let’s discuss upcoming events in the Rust community. Are you feeling nostalgic for travel? Over the next two weeks you can take a trip around the world through online Rust meetups - including in Johannesburg, South Africa, Dublin, Ireland, Linz, Austria, Berlin, Germany, Saarbrücken, Germany, Buffalo, New York, Indianapolis, Indiana, Seattle, Washington, and San Diego, California. Enjoy your trip!

Additionally, an in person meetup is currently scheduled in Columbus, Ohio.

And that’s it for the summary of This Week in Rust issue number 350. Now, let’s move onto interviews with some of the RustConf speakers.

Our first interview is with Sian Griffin, who will be presenting the closing keynote of RustConf.
